# Authentication-
This project aims at showing the best way of keeping user credentials in the database.
After the password is hashed,the password is appended on the hash and saved in the database.
This makes it impoossible for the hackers to access the users credentials since the hash is generated randomly 
for each user.
The API used in connection to the databse is jdbc.
